# CAP Theorem explained with a horse and carriage

You are king or queen of a vast realm. Your subjects depend on your wise decision making, and your law to maintain order. 

Therefore you've written down all laws so that every citizen knows what is lawfully permitted, and what is a criminal offense. 

It would hardly be just if somebody was punished for a crime they did not know existed. You decide it's important for all people to be able to see these laws. You send your messengers across the kingdom to the many cities in your realm, each with a tablet inscribing all of the laws, to be placed in the public square and announced for those who can't read. 

Unfortunately, some of your messengers return with reports that a major road has been blocked by a flood. The river is uncrossable. There is simply no way to deliver the tablets until the flood waters recede, which coud be weeks. 

This puts you in a conundrum. You could hold off on adopting these new laws on principle that everybody must see the same sets of laws. But it could be some time.

The CAP theorem can be used to explain this situation. It was originally envisioned as a triangle where you can only pick two:

* Consistency (everybody city has the same laws)
* Availability (there are laws on display, even if they are out of date)
* Partition Tolerance (Roads being flooded)

The more modern thinking on the CAP theorem is that partitions are unavoidable. Just like a King or Queen can't stop a flood, network engineers can't always stop a broken router or a server from going dark.

Consistency suggests that all computers in the network have the same data, just like all cities in our kingdom see the same sets of laws. Due to blocked roads, you're forced to hide the laws from everybody until you can be sure that every city has seen the new set of laws.

If you relaxed that requirement, you allow some cities to show maybe an older version of the laws even when the roads are blocked, you're choosing to prioritize availability. Prioritizing availability means that for some cities, the laws may be out of date, but at least there's some laws on display, potentially important to keep the peace. While the flood is ongoing, cities outside of the reach of the Capital operate on their own set of laws. 

The only way to stay consistent (to have all laws be the same) and available (the laws are on display) is to have clear roads and no partitions. To make sure everybody is on the same page, you'd want riders returning from each city confirming that the new laws are in fact on display, at which point you can confidently say the laws are universal. 

Databases make these tradeoffs when replicating or horizontally scaling. [Postgres recommends many ways of replicating your data](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/different-replication-solutions.html). Some of them are consistent:

**Shared Disk Failover** 
> Uses a single disk array that is shared by multiple servers. If the main database server fails, the standby server is able to mount and start the database as though it were recovering from a database crash. This allows rapid failover with no data loss.

> One significant limitation of this method is that if the shared disk array fails or becomes corrupt, the primary and standby servers are both nonfunctional

**File System (Block Device) Replication**
> All changes to a file system are mirrored to a file system residing on another computer. The only restriction is that the mirroring must be done in a way that ensures the standby server has a consistent copy of the file system

**SQL-Based Replication Middleware**
> A program intercepts every SQL query and sends it to one or all servers. Each server operates independently. Read-write queries must be sent to all servers, so that every server receives any changes. But read-only queries can be sent to just one server, allowing the read workload to be distributed among them.

> Care must also be taken that all transactions either commit or abort on all servers, perhaps using two-phase commit (PREPARE TRANSACTION and COMMIT PREPARED).

Notice how all of these methods require the replica to be online. That's the price of consistency. Other Postgres replications relax the consistency, and focus more on availability:

**Write-Ahead Log Shipping**
> Warm and hot standby servers can be kept current by reading a stream of write-ahead log (WAL) records. If the main server fails, the standby contains **almost all of the data** of the main server, and can be quickly made the new primary database server.

**Logical Replication**
> Logical replication allows a database server to send a stream of data modifications to another server.

> On the other hand, if there are other writes done either by an application or by other subscribers to the same set of tables, conflicts can arise.

**Trigger-Based Primary-Standby Replication** 

> Operating on a per-table basis, the primary server sends data changes (typically) asynchronously to the standby servers.

> Because it updates the standby server asynchronously (in batches), there is possible data loss during fail over.

**Asynchronous Multimaster Replication**

> Each server works independently, and periodically communicates with the other servers to identify conflicting transactions. The conflicts can be resolved by users or conflict resolution rules.

Notice how all of these availability first strategies all involve some form of data loss (not consistent) when a failover happens and if writes are allowed on replicas there are conflicts that need to be resolved. That's the price of availability.

Once the roads clear, your messengers deliver the laws to the furthest parts of your kingdom. You can rest assured knowing that nobody will be punished for a law they were unaware of. That is, until you need to make changes to the law. You're getting nervous about any blocked roads as you're starting to realize it's the same problem all over again.
